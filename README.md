## Projects

### 2024

### Random Projection Ensemble Classification
[Code](https://github.com/sam-yak/Random-Projection-Ensemble-Classification/blob/main/DATA_MINING_CODE_UPDATED.ipynb)

Cardiac arrhythmias, manifesting as irregular heart rhythms, present substantial diagnostic challenges exacerbated by the complexity and high dimensionality of electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Conventional classification methods frequently fall short in precision, struggling with the nuanced ECG patterns. This study harnesses the random-projection ensemble classification technique, originally innovated by Timothy I. Cannings and Richard J. Samworth, to enhance the accuracy of diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia. By utilizing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, our approach projects the high-dimensional ECG data into a lower-dimensional space. This method effectively reduces the curse of dimensionality and uncovers underlying structures that are conducive to more accurate classifications, offering a promising advancement in medical diagnostics.


### Survival-Analysis-Employee-Retention
[Code](https://github.com/sam-yak/Survival-Analysis-Employee-Retention/blob/main/Survival_analysis_final.ipynb)

Survival analysis has emerged as a crucial statistical tool for analyzing time-to-event data, providing insights into the longevity and retention patterns across various domains, including employee attrition. This project employs survival analysis to investigate the duration employees remain with a company before potentially exiting, utilizing the Kaplan-Meier Fitter and Cox Proportional Hazards Model. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset with multiple covariates, we identify key periods and factors that influence employee tenure. The survival functions were calculated for different demographic and job-related variables, such as job involvement and work-life balance, to assess their impact on retention. The study highlights how variations in these factors correlate with significant differences in attrition rates, offering strategic insights for human resources to enhance employee retention and satisfaction. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of survival analysis in providing actionable insights into employee retention strategies and the dynamics of workforce stability.


### Sentiment Analysis of WhatsApp Chats
[Code](https://github.com/sam-yak/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/sentimentanalysis.pdf)
This project performs sentiment and emotion analysis on WhatsApp chat data, particularly focusing on Hinglish (Hindi words written using the English alphabet). The analysis includes mapping the sentiment and emotions over time, visualizing the results, and providing summary statistics. The goal is to understand the emotional dynamics and overall tone of the conversation.

### Neural-Network-project- on Spotify data - Comparing the different levels of track popularity of 'pop' and 'rap' genres.
[Code](https://github.com/sam-yak/Neural-Network-project/blob/main/Neural-network-project.ipynb)

In this project, I have completed key analyses including neural network training with performance monitoring through loss plots, prediction interval calculation using conformal inference, and a carefully chosen hypothesis test.
Neural Network Training: We trained a neural network on the provided dataset. The training process was monitored and optimized by plotting the loss against each training iteration. This plot is included in the notebook, illustrating how the model's performance improved over time.
Prediction Interval Using Conformal Inference: We calculated a prediction interval using conformal inference. The results are accompanied by a detailed explanation, elucidating how this approach provides a statistical basis for the reliability of the predictions made by our model.
Hypothesis Testing: A specific hypothesis test was conducted, chosen based on the characteristics of our dataset and the objectives of our analysis. The notebook includes a comprehensive explanation of why this particular test was selected and an interpretation of the test results, providing insights into the statistical significance and implications of our findings.
In conclusion the 'pop' and 'rap' genres have significantly different levels of track popularity. This finding could be useful for various purposes, such as marketing strategies, playlist curation, or further analysis on what drives popularity differences between genres.

### Green Horizons: Advancing Crop Yield Predictions through Environmental Data Analytics
[Code](https://github.com/sam-yak/Crop-Yield-Predictions/blob/main/Time_Series_Regression_Project_final%20(1).ipynb)

In our ambitious project, we aim to harness the potential of advanced machine learning techniques, primarily using Python, to predict agricultural crop yields. This task is more than just a technical challenge; it represents a significant step towards ensuring global food security and adapting agricultural practices to the challenges posed by climate change. Our approach involves a detailed analysis of various environmental factors such as weather patterns, soil conditions, and historical crop yield data, as well as the application and effectiveness of pesticides. By meticulously processing this data through sophisticated machine learning algorithms, our goal is to develop a robust predictive model. This model is not just a tool for theoretical analysis but a practical solution to aid farmers and policymakers in making informed decisions. Through our work, we envision contributing significantly to the optimization of crop yields, promoting sustainable farming methods, and ultimately assisting in the battle against food scarcity in the face of changing global climates.
